# TrafiTrackFinalDesignDocument
The proposed name of the system is Trafi Track , which unify the vehicle tracking and tax management
operation into centralized web-based service. The goal of the system is to give tax authorities the ability to
collect taxes based on vehicle usage. System will also provide means to monitor vehicle owner based road
usage and provide data for billing purposes. Moreover, the system serves vehicle tracking information and
other location based information about vehicle usage for different kind of vehicle users. Vehicle tracking
system also supports automatic emergency calling system standard eCall.
This document is intended to visualize and convey the significant architectural decisions in order to
represent the overview of vehicle tracking system for small nordic country. By analysing the architectural
overview, people involved in the project can better understand the problems to be solved and how it will be
represented with this system. Likewise, the final application must be efficient and very easy to use. In this
document, we also describe the physical architecture of the system that must be constructed by using GPS
for positioning information and GSM/GPRS for transmission of the information.
